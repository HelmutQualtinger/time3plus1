The Collatz Conjecture

This is a playground for playing with the infamous times 3 plus 1 algorithm. Arguably the simples chaotic algorithm known.

Consider the following operation on an arbitrary positive integer:

If the number is even, divide it by two.
If the number is odd, triple it and add one.
In modular arithmetic notation, define the function f as follows:

It is hitherto unkwon whether number exist for which this series diverges. Empirically all number ab to 2*62 seem to end up in a loop 
1->4->1 no longer circles have been observed

Philosophically this algorithm offers serious insight. Even ridiculosly simple, well defined processes may have totally unpredictable outcomes. Unpredictabilty does not necesseraly  ensue a lack of information and does not require complexity
